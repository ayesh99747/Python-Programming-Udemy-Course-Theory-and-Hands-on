#   5.	Boolean Operators and, or, not - compare values and evaluate to a single Boolean 
#       value.

#   •	and - if the Boolean values on both sides of the and keyword are True, then the 
#       expression evaluates to True. If either or both of the Boolean values are False, 
#       then the expression evaluates to False.

#   a)	Would the following evaluate to True or False? Test your answers by entering the following expressions into the interactive shell at the prompt symbol (>>>):
#           >>> True and True
#           >>> True and False
#           >>> False and True
#           >>> False and False
#           >>> spam = 'Hello'
#           >>> 10 < 20 and spam == 'Hello'

#   •	Note that 10 < 20 evaluates to True and spam == 'Hello' also evaluates to True, 
#       so the two Boolean expressions joined by the and operator evaluate as True.
