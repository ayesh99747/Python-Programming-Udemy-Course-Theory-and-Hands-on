#   •	or - evaluates to True if either of the two Boolean values is True. 
#       The only time the or operator evaluates to False is if both of the Boolean 
#       values are False.

#   c)	Would the following evaluate to True or False? Test your answers by entering the 
#       following expressions into the interactive shell at the prompt symbol (>>>):
#           >>> True or True
#           >>> True or False
#           >>> False or True
#           >>> False or False
#           >>> 10 > 20 or 20 > 10

#   •	In the last example, 10 is not greater than 20 but 20 is greater than 10, 
#       so the first expression evaluates to False and the second expression evaluates to 
#       True. Because the second expression is True, this whole expression evaluates as True.
