#   Question 2. 
#       Write the pseudocode to put zero into variable running_total. 
#       Then write separate instructions to add the following numbers onto what is in the 
#       variable, adding one number at a time 5, 8, 2, 3. Print running_total.

# DECLARE running_total = 0
# CALCULATE running_total = running_total + 5
# CALCULATE running_total = running_total + 8
# CALCULATE running_total = running_total + 2
# CALCULATE running_total = running_total + 3
# DISPLAY running_total
