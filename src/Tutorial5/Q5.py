#   5. Write a program that simulates the rolling of two six-sided dice and then counts 
#      the number of times that the dice generate a double (e.g. both dice shown the same 
#      value). Roll the dice 100 times and then print the number of doubles. Example output., 
#      Out of 100 you rolled 20 doubles
