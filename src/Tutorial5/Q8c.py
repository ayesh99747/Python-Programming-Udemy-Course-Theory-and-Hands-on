# C) This code would be more useful in a loop:
#
#   while True:
#       n = input("Please enter an integer: ")
#       try:
#           n = int(n)
#           break
#       except ValueError:
#       print("Requires a valid integer! Please try again.")
#   print("You successfully entered an integer.")
#
# Example output:
#   Please enter an integer: r
#   Requires a valid integer! Please try again.
#   Please enter an integer: 10.6
#   Requires a valid integer! Please try again.
#   Please enter an integer: 5
#   You successfully entered an integer.
