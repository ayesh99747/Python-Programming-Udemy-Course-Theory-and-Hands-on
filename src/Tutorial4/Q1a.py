#   The solution for exercise 1 should use a while that will loop until the user guesses 
#   a ‘hidden’ number.
#   Part A - 
#       • Initialise a variable hidden with a value of 6.
#       • Ask the user to guess the hidden number (an integer between 1 and 20). Remember 
#         to use the int function to convert string input to an integer number.
#       • If the guess does not match the hidden number the program will run the while 
#         loop ‘block’.
#           o To state the guess was not correct, and ask the user for another guess.
#       • Loop while the guess entered by the user is not the hidden number.
#       • When the guess is correct, exit the loop and let the user know they were correct.
