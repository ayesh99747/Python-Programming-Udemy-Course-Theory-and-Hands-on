# Exercise 3
#   • Write a program that will allow a user to enter a number of scores until -9 is entered.
#   • When -9 is entered, print the average of the scores entered. Use a while loop.
#   • Ensure that at least one score has been entered before calculating the average 
#     (division by zero would produce an error).
